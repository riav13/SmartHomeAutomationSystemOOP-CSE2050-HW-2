# SmartHomeAutomationSystemOOP-CSE2050-HW-2
The goal of this assignment is to design a simple smart home automation system using object- oriented programming concepts in Python. The goal of this assignment is to design a simple smart home automation system using object-
oriented programming concepts in Python. You will model different smart home devices (lights,
thermostats, and speakers) using classes, and allow them to interact with each other through
composition and inheritance. You will also implement magic methods (and operator overloading)
to simulate a realistic smart home system.

Mostly uses the concept of inheritance, and that the self parameter carries over because it is a placeholder for the instance you create in main. The child classes inherit traits from the parent class and you have to carry over the def init method and use .super() for this
